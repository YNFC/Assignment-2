/* This file is to tell you where i got my codes from 

My source codes are mainly from the lecture recordings. After that i used the bootstrap app to choose a site i liked.
I chose the pricing web page and modified it to my liking for this project.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/pricing/
this is the link to that. 
i also used font awesome to add some icons to the project like you did in the lecutre recordings. 
heres the link for that
https://fontawesome.com/search?q=info&o=r
the navbar bootstrap was also done from the lecture recordings using this site
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
I also used the npm link to download and add the libraries and tools i would need for this as you had said in the recordings.
Heres the link for that
https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect
